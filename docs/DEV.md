# Development Workflow

## Simulation (RTL Verification)

Always verify logic changes in simulation before synthesis. The testbench covers:

* Aligned & Unaligned Accesses.
* Byte/Half/Word/DWord transfers.
* Randomized Backpressure (Wait States) from Slave.

To run simulation:

1. Open Vivado Project (`make open`).
2. Click **Run Simulation** $\to$ **Run Behavioral Simulation**.

## Hardware Build (Tcl & Make)

The project uses a script-based flow to ensure reproducibility.

* `make project`: Recreates the `.xpr` from `create_project.tcl` and `design_1.tcl`.
* `make bitstream`: Runs Synthesis, Implementation, and exports the XSA/HWH.
* `make export-bd`: Saves changes made in the GUI back to the `bd/` source directory. **Run this after modifying the Block Design.**

## Software Development (Python/PYNQ)

Drivers are located in `software/`.

* `driver.py`: Low-level driver class (`SimpleAxiMasterDriver`). Abstractions for `write`, `read`, and `status` polling.
* `enums.py`: Constants for Operation types and Sizes.
* `demo.ipynb`: Interactive dashboard with memory visualization and manual transaction controls.

### Deployment

Files in `overlay/` (`demo.bit`, `demo.hwh`) are automatically generated by `make bitstream`. Ensure these match exactly when copying to the board.
